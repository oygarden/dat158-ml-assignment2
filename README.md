# Location-based wallpaper generation

This is a simple script that generates a wallpaper based on your location, time, and weather.

## Usage

To use the script you need to register an account with OpenAI and generate an API key. 

The openai package uses the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to authenticate requests (unless you set it manually). See the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup) for more information.
